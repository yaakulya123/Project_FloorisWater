## üåä Water Mechanics

### Flooding Pattern
1. **Initial Flood**: Water simultaneously appears in all four corners of the city
2. **Spread Pattern**: Water randomly spreads to adjacent non-water tiles
3. **Speed Control**: Adjustable timing (100ms - 2000ms+ intervals)
4. **Visual Effect**: Smooth drowning animation when tiles convert to water

### Water Properties
- **Color**: Beautiful blue gradient with shimmer animation
- **Height**: Same as the tile it replaces
- **Animation**: Continuous water shimmer effect
- **Transition**: 1-second drowning animation before conversion

## üéÆ Controls & Interface

### Control Panel (Top Left)
- **Start Water Spread**: Begin the flooding simulation
- **Pause**: Stop water spread temporarily
- **Reset Board**: Restore city to original state
- **Speed Up**: Decrease interval by 200ms (faster flooding)
- **Slow Down**: Increase interval by 200ms (slower flooding)

### Status Panel (Top Right)
- **Land Tiles**: Count of remaining non-water tiles
- **Water Tiles**: Count of flooded tiles
- **Speed**: Current flooding interval in milliseconds

## üé® Visual Features

### 3D Isometric Design
- **Perspective**: 60¬∞ X-rotation, -30¬∞ Y-rotation (default)
- **Grid Size**: 30x30 tiles (900 total)
- **Tile Size**: 20x20 pixels
- **Depth**: Variable heights create dramatic cityscape

### Lighting & Effects
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Each building type has unique lighting
- **Window Patterns**: Radial gradients simulate lit windows
- **Shadow System**: Realistic drop shadows based on building height
- **Shimmer Animation**: Water tiles have flowing light effects
- **Glow Effects**: Special buildings pulse with energy

### Building Details
- **Window Grids**: Different patterns for each building type
- **Floor Divisions**: Repeating lines simulate building floors
- **Surface Texture**: Subtle patterns on all surfaces
- **Realistic Materials**: Each building type has appropriate textures

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **3D Rendering**: CSS3 Transforms with `transform-style: preserve-3d`
- **Animations**: CSS animations and transitions
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Performance
- **Grid Size**: 30x30 = 900 tiles
- **DOM Elements**: ~5,400 elements (6 faces per tile)

## üöÄ How to Play

### Getting Started
1. **Open the Game**: Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. **Explore the City**: Click and drag to rotate the view and explore the detailed city
3. **Start Flooding**: Click "Start Water Spread" to begin the simulation
4. **Watch & Control**: Use speed controls to adjust the flooding pace
5. **Reset & Replay**: Reset the board to watch different flooding patterns

### Gameplay Loop
1. **City Generation**: Each reset creates a slightly different city layout (random building placement)
2. **Corner Flooding**: Water begins simultaneously from all four corners
3. **Spread Simulation**: Water randomly spreads to adjacent tiles
4. **City Consumption**: Watch as roads flood first, then buildings by height
5. **Game Over**: When all tiles are flooded, the simulation ends

### Strategic Observation
- **Roads flood first** (lowest elevation)
- **Parks and base land** flood early
- **Low buildings** resist briefly
- **Medium and tall buildings** last longer
- **Special landmarks** are the final holdouts
